# Python  Learning Notes

**Overview**  
Python is a popular, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in many areas, such as:

- **Web Development**: Backend frameworks like Django and Flask.
- **Data Science and Machine Learning**: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow.
- **Automation and Scripting**: Automate repetitive tasks or system processes.
- **Software Development**: Build desktop or mobile apps.
- **Game Development**: Simple games using libraries like Pygmy.
- **Networking and Cybersecurity**: Writing network tools and hacking scripts.

**Prerequisites**  
- Install Python from  https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Use a code editor like VS Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text

Why Learn Python?

Ease of Learning: Python’s simple syntax resembles natural language, making it an excellent choice for beginners.
Versatility: Python can be used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and many other applications.
Community Support: Python has a large, active community and extensive documentation, making it easier to find help and resources.

## Python Basics

## Writing and Running Your First Python Script

** Create a Python Script:

Open your code editor and create a new file named hello.py.

````Type the code

print('this is my first python code')

````
**Run the Script:

Save the file and open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where hello.py is located.
Run the script using the command:

You should see the output: Hello, World!

## Understanding Python’s Basic Syntax:

**Indentation:

Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define blocks of code. For example, functions and loops require consistent indentation.
Variables and Data Types:

Python variables don’t require explicit declaration and can store different types of data, such as integers, floats, strings, and more.
Comments:

Use the # symbol to add comments to your code, which are ignored during execution but help explain what the code does.

 ## Python Fundamentals
**Data Types:

Understand basic data types like integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), and boolean values (bool).
Control Flow:

In Python, you do not have to explicitly declare a data type and Python will work with that under the hood and if you are writing string 
around them with code and if you are working with numbers just write them like `` number = 33 ``

Python emphasizes readability and clean code. Follow PEP 8, the official Python style guide, to write clean and readable code.
Experiment:



**1. Variables and Data Types**  
Variables store data. You don't need to declare the type.
```python
name = "John"   # string
age = 25        # integer
height = 5.9    # float
is_student = True  # boolean 


````
